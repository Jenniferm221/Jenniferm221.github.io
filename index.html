				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					<p>Hi! My name is Jenn McLaughlin, and for the past 20+ years I have watched computers slowly
						transform how we live our lives. As a teenager I loved trying to figure
						out how computers worked, spending countless hours tinkering with simple HTML and CSS to build
						very simple and modest websites that were only hosted on my own computer. This desire stayed
						with me my entire life but took a back seat as I grew older, work, family, children, bills- you
						know how it goes, sometimes we lose sight of the things we are passionate about along the way.
						It wasn’t until mid-2018 that this would change for me. I found myself at a turning point in my
						life after learning that I was being laid off from the company I had worked at for nearly a
						decade. What was I going to do next? That is when I decided it was time to rediscover my passion
						for coding and get a formal education on Web Development. After enrolling in a coding bootcamp
						and spending many hours with my keyboard, I realized this old hobby of mine was something I
						wanted to do with my life and currently am working on building websites and web applications for
						clients. Below you will see some of my first projects.</p>

					<p>Bloc Jams is a my first React SPA that was built as part of my curriculum through Bloc. It is an
						SPA for albums and music that uses React Router to create a responsive page that works on mobile
						as well. I started out by building the basic routes with React Router. After that I built up the
						functionality of the library, album, and music player controls using React. The page was then
						finally styled through the use of Semantic UI - React. This was my first time working to build
						an SPA completely with React. It was a learning experience in managing state and props, while
						building a responsive webpage.</p>

							src="https://i.imgur.com/eX8wJyO.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>My second project while studying web development was to build a chat application. This
						application is coded to allow users to add new chatrooms, update messages and chat in their
						selected room. Firebase was used to authenticate each user. The page was styled using Material
						UI. It is mobile responsive, though it is best used on a desktop platform.</p>

							src="https://i.imgur.com/UYmEta7.png" alt="battleship picture" /></a>
					<p>To further practice my coding skills I wanted to make a few different kinds of projects other
						then the React work I did with Bloc. This Battleship project is a simple execution of HTMLS, CSS
						and JavaScript. It uses programing logic to place the ships on the board, and as you "Fire!" at
						your opponent It will tell you if you successfully "hit" or "missed". This was alot of fun to
						make! It has full functionality and is mobile responsive.</p>

					<p>Being from the Philadelphia area made doing a project around the Philadelphia Eagles a no
						brainier, especially after we won the Super Bowl in 2018! This project utilizes HTML5,
						JavaScriptand CSS to bring to life a Philadelphia Eagles themed memory match game. Thisproject
						was a lot of fun to build. Upon loading the images shuffle to different places for each game so
						there is always a different experience. This particular application got a lot of use in my
						house, and some brownie points with my son which is always a plus. E-A-G-L-E-S ....EAGLES!!</p>
